Parenting done with Python

I watched [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfGZpx0iGvM) By Kalle Hallden
who went on to suggest that everyone needs a personal database as a passion project
to help them build skill in programming, but also to perform useful tasks.  Like
reminding you a week before your dad's birthday to buy and mail him a card.

My wife just mentioned she would like to keep an "Excuses" list that let's us
easily catagorize the excuses our not quite teenager uses for not doing something.
As well as how long after being asked to do the task, she gives us the excuse.
We thought it might be fun to keep track of how many times each excuse is used.

So, I guess I know what my Personal Database is going to start out as.  :)
